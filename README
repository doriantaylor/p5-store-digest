NAME
    Store::Digest - Store opaque data objects keyed on their cryptographic
    digests

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        use Store::Digest;

        # initialize the store

        my $store = Store::Digest->new(
            driver  => 'FileSystem',
            # all other options pass through to the driver
            dir     => '/var/db/store-digest',
        );

        # add an object

        my $obj = $store->add(
            content  => $fh,
            language => 'en',
            mtime    => DateTime->now,
        );

        # if you want to get the object back

        my $str = 'ni:///sha-256;IcnxQtEMlihv1wFHTMjkMprLO-9-ZXZD2lcsQLmQ1xA';
        my $uri = URI->new($str);
        my $obj = $store->get($uri);

METHODS
    This module will eventually act as a unifying interface for multiple
    storage drivers, but there is currently only one implemented:
    Store::Digest::Driver::FileSystem. Go see that.

        Note to users prior to this version (all two of you): The "control"
        database that contains the store-wide metadata was for some stupid
        reason a BerkeleyDB::Hash, and I have changed it to be a
        BerkeleyDB::Btree. I have included a conversion routine in the
        driver which *should* do the job transparently, but since it deletes
        the old control database, you may run into trouble if you don't shut
        down all processes attached to this database before upgrading.
