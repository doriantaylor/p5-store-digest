=head1 NAME

Store::Digest - Store opaque data objects keyed on their cryptographic digests

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.07

has _driver => (

);

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Store::Digest;

    # initialize the store

    my $store = Store::Digest->new(
        driver  => 'FileSystem',
        # all other options pass through to the driver
        dir     => '/var/db/store-digest',
    );

    # add an object

    my $obj = $store->add(
        content  => $fh,
        language => 'en',
        mtime    => DateTime->now,
    );

    # if you want to get the object back

    my $str = 'ni:///sha-256;IcnxQtEMlihv1wFHTMjkMprLO-9-ZXZD2lcsQLmQ1xA';
    my $uri = URI->new($str);
    my $obj = $store->get($uri);

=head1 METHODS

This module will eventually act as a unifying interface for multiple
storage drivers, but there is currently only one implemented:
L<Store::Digest::Driver::FileSystem>. Go see that.

B<Note to users prior to this version> (all two of you): The
C<control> database that contains the store-wide metadata was for some
stupid reason a L<BerkeleyDB::Hash>, and I have changed it to be a
L<BerkeleyDB::Btree>. I have included a conversion routine in the
driver which I<should> do the job transparently, but since it deletes
the old control database, you may run into trouble if you don't shut
down all processes attached to this database before upgrading.
