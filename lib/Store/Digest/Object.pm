=head1 NAME

Store::Digest::Object - One distinct Store::Digest data object

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dataobj = $store->get('sha-256' => $key);

    my $fh = $dataobj->content;


=head1 METHODS

This class exists to encapsulate the metadata relevant to a
L<Store::Digest> data object. It is not instantiated directly. All
methods are read-only accessors.

=head2 content

Returns a filehandle or equivalent, pointing to the object's content,
open in read-only mode. Unless the object has been deleted, then this
will be C<undef>.

=cut

# has content => (
#     is       => 'ro',
#     required => 0,
#     isa      => Maybe[FiniteHandle],
# );

has _content => (
    is       => 'rw',
    required => 0,
    isa      => Maybe[CodeRef|FiniteHandle],
    init_arg => 'content',
);

sub content {
    my $self = shift;
    my $content = $self->_content;
    if ($content and ref $content eq 'CODE') {
        $content = $content->();
        $self->_content($content);
    }
    $content;
}

=head2 digest

    my $uri = $dataobj->digest('sha-1');

    my @algos = $dataobj->digest;

Returns a L<URI::di> object for the relevant digest algorithm. Will
croak if an invalid digest algorithm is supplied. While valid digest
algorithms are specified at creation time, you can retrieve them by
calling this method with no arguments.

=cut

has _digests => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => DigestHash,
    required => 1,
    init_arg => 'digests',
);

sub digest {
    my ($self, $algo) = @_;
    my $d = $self->_digests;
    unless (defined $algo) {
        my @k = sort keys %$d;
        return wantarray ? @k : \@k;
    }

    # lowercase it
    $algo = lc $algo;

    # hee hee self-reference
    Carp::croak("No algorithm named $algo, only " . join ' ' , $self->digest)
          unless defined $d->{$algo};

    # clone the URI so that it can't be messed with
    $d->{$algo}->clone;
}

=head2 size

Returns the byte size of the object. Note that for deleted objects,
this will be whatever the size of the object was before it was
deleted.

=cut

has size => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => NonNegativeInt,
    required => 1,
);

=head2 type

Returns the MIME type

=cut

has type => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Maybe[ContentType],
    required => 0,
);

=head2 charset

Returns the character set (e.g. C<utf-8>) of the data object if known.

=cut

has charset => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Maybe[Token],
    required => 0,
);

=head2 language

Returns the natural language in
L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646|RFC 5646> format, if it was
supplied.

=cut

has language => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Maybe[Token],
    required => 0,
);

=head2 encoding

Returns the I<transfer encoding>, of the data object if known,
(e.g. C<gzip> or C<deflate>, I<not> the L</charset>).

=cut

has encoding => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Maybe[Token],
    required => 0,
);

=head2 ctime

Returns the timestamp at which the object was I<added> to
the store, from the point of view of the system.

=cut

has ctime => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => DateTime,
    required => 1,
    coerce   => 1,
);

=head2 mtime

Returns the timestamp that was supplied as the modification time of
the object from the point of view of the I<user>, if different from
L</ctime>.

=cut

has mtime => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => MaybeDateTime,
    required => 0,
    coerce   => 1,
);

=head2 dtime

Returns the system timestamp at which the object was I<deleted>, if
applicable.

=cut

has dtime => (
    is       => 'rw',
    isa      => MaybeDateTime,
    required => 0,
    coerce   => 1,

    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Int,
    required => 1,
    default  => 0,
    init_arg => 'flags',
