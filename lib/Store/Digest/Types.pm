=head1 NAME

Store::Digest::Types - Custom types for Store::Digest;

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Store::Digest::XYZ;

    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;

    use Store::Digest::Types;

    # ... do your thing

=head1 TYPES

=head2 DateTimeType

=cut

subtype DateTimeType, as class_type('DateTime');
coerce DateTimeType,  from Int, via { DateTime->from_epoch(epoch => shift) };

subtype MaybeDateTime, as Maybe[DateTimeType];

coerce MaybeDateTime, from Maybe[Int],
    via { $_[0] ? DateTime->from_epoch(epoch => $_[0]) : undef };

=head2 DigestHash

=cut

subtype DigestURI, as class_type('URI::ni');

subtype DigestHash, as HashRef[DigestURI];

=head2 FiniteHandle

=cut

subtype Seekable,  as class_type('IO::Seekable');

subtype FiniteHandle, as FileHandle|Seekable;

=head2 File and Directory

These are just labels for L<Path::Class> objects.

=cut

subtype File,      as class_type('Path::Class::File');
subtype Directory, as class_type('Path::Class::Dir');

coerce File,      from Str, via { Path::Class::File->new(shift) };
coerce Directory, from Str, via { Path::Class::Dir->new(shift)  };

=head2 Token

A token, as described by L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616|RFC
2616>, section 2.2.

=cut

# XXX this screws up
#my $bads = quotemeta('()<>@,;:\"/[]?={}');
#my $token = qr![^\x00-x20\x7f-\xff$bads]+!o;

# XXX this is the above, rewritten, and works.
my $token = qr/[!#\$&'*+.^_`|~0-9A-Za-z-]+/;


# that's what RFC2616 says, which would frankly make for some wackass
# "tokens".

subtype Token, as Str, where { /^$token$/o };

subtype MaybeToken, as Maybe[Token];

=head2 ContentType

A registered (or not) MIME type, in C<major/minor> notation.

=cut

subtype ContentType, as Str, where { m!^$token/$token$!o };

subtype RFC3066, as Str, where { m!^[a-zA-Z]{1,8}(-[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,8})*$! };

=head2 NonNegativeInt

An integer which is zero or greater. Kinda like an unsigned int, I
suppose, except I don't care about how the underlying integer is
implemented, I just care that it's at least zero.

=cut

subtype NonNegativeInt, as Int, where { $_ >= 0 };

=head2 StoreObject

=cut

subtype StoreObject, as class_type('Store::Digest::Object');
